Problem:

Often times, someone forgets a birthday or another important event occurring once a year of a
family member and this may lead to tensions in family relations, guiltiness, and various
other negative outcomes. The proposed program would make sure you remember the important date, and
whose special day it is!

Primary StakeHolder: 
Anyone can use this application for their benefit, as it can remind anyone about the important dates. The user will benefit from the application as he/she will get reminded about the various important events and the name of the person and
how the person is related to the user.

Graphical User Interface:

Any form of a box or a dialog box can be used to put in the data shown in the Output Example, along with an image of the special person if available. 

Data Structure: 

We can use a graph to store different people as vertices and their relation to other people as edges.  A Person object can be stored at each vertex, which would include a name, age, birthday, and possibly an image file.  Graph traversals would always start at the user's vertex and find the vertex of the desired person.  Once that vertex is found, the shortest possible path would be computed and printed out.  As each edge from the user to the person is traversed, that edge's label (person's relation to other person) would be printed.  An array of arrays can be used to store special events at each day.  When the program is opened, the people associated with the current day would be searched for in the tree to begin the process.

eg: Today is John's (user), Dad's ( Peter) , Sister's (Susan) , Husband's (Griffin), Brother's (Donald) Birthday !!!

 

Input Data File Format: A CSV file could be used, which specifies the family members in order of their age and spouses, eg: great grandmother and great grandfather first, then their kids and spouses and so on.  This CSV file 

 

Output Example:

start OUTPUT 

     Good Morning User, 

     Today is Donald's Birthday (March 26)

     How are you related ?

                    Donald,  brother of Griffin, husband of Susan, sister of Peter, Father of User.

     Hope you have a nice and an amazing day :)

Milestones: 

1. Implementing a proper data structure of the family tree and mapping it using a graph and testing proper retrieval structure using graphs (every retrieval should be the shortest path from point A to point B).

2. Implementing Date and Time functionality used to display the date on which the special occasion occurred.

3. Making sure the GUI works as per the agreed drawings.
